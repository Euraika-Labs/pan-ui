# Changelog

All notable changes to Pan by Euraika are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Fork session crash** — missing closing `)` in `forkRealSession` Python bridge caused all session forks to fail with a syntax error

### Changed
- **Health probe decoupled from binary** — `getHermesRuntimeStatus()` now probes the API gateway and detects filesystem assets (config, memories, sessions, skills) even when no `hermes` binary is present. Docker and headless deployments report full health status instead of blanket "unavailable".

### Added
- **Docker test image** — `tests/docker/Dockerfile.test` bundles Hermes Agent (via `uv` + Euraika-Labs fork @ `pan-v0.7.0`). All 7/7 health checks pass inside the container.
- **Docker test suites** — mock-mode (`docker-test.sh`, 37 assertions incl. 7 Playwright E2E) and real-mode (`docker-real-test.sh`, 28 assertions against a live gateway)
- **Full-stack functional test** — `tests/functional/full-stack-test.sh` (33 assertions): clean build → standalone start → auth → CRUD → APIs → pages → unit → E2E
- **`.dockerignore`** — optimised Docker build context

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Vendored Hermes fork** — Pan now pins and manages its own Hermes Agent binary from `Euraika-Labs/hermes-agent`. Version requirements defined in `hermes.version.json` at the repo root.
- **Auto-install Hermes** — if no `hermes` binary is found, Pan's setup wizard offers to clone and install the vendored fork automatically via `pip install -e .`
- **Version compatibility checks** — startup validates installed Hermes version against `minVersion`/`maxVersion` from `hermes.version.json` and warns on mismatch
- **`pan-ui sync-hermes`** — new CLI subcommand to update Hermes to the pinned version
- **`pan-ui update`** — check for and install Pan updates from npm
- **`pan-ui version`** — display current Pan version
- **`pan-ui help`** — show full CLI usage
- **Update banner** — in-app notification when a newer Pan version is available on npm
- **Update check API** — `/api/runtime/update-check` endpoint for the frontend banner

### Changed
- **CLI refactored to subcommand structure** — `pan-ui start`, `pan-ui stop`, `pan-ui status`, `pan-ui logs`, `pan-ui setup`, `pan-ui service install|remove`. Old flag-style (`--daemon`) still works for backward compatibility.
- **Profile detection hardened** — `getActiveProfileId()` now resolves the active Hermes profile dynamically without hardcoded names or `HERMES_HOME` env var. Falls back gracefully when only one profile exists.
- **Runtime bridge** — improved error handling and profile-aware path resolution

### Fixed
- Hub skills cache reads use profile-aware paths consistently
- Profile context no longer crashes when `~/.hermes/profiles/` contains non-directory entries

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Automatic gateway management** — Pan now auto-detects and starts the Hermes gateway (`hermes gateway run`) on boot. No manual gateway setup required; just start Pan and chat works immediately.
- **Gateway health monitor** — background health check every 30 s auto-restarts the gateway if it crashes (only when Pan spawned it)
- **Graceful shutdown** — gateway child process is cleaned up on SIGINT/SIGTERM/exit
- Next.js `instrumentation.ts` hook bootstraps the gateway manager at server start

### Changed
- **Simplified deployment** — only one process/service needed. The separate `hermes-gateway.service` systemd unit is no longer required; Pan manages the gateway lifecycle internally.
- Architecture diagram updated to show the gateway manager layer

### Fixed
- Gateway no longer requires hardcoded profile names or `HERMES_HOME` env var — Hermes uses its own active profile detection

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Session source badges** — sessions now display their origin (CLI, WebUI, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.) with color-coded badges in the sidebar
- **Source filter chips** — filter the session sidebar by source when multiple sources are present (auto-hidden for single-source lists)
- **Resume button** for external sessions — one-click to resume CLI, API, and messaging sessions from the WebUI
- `SessionSource` type union covering 13 platforms (webui, cli, api, discord, telegram, whatsapp, signal, slack, matrix, mattermost, sms, email, unknown)
- `X-Hermes-Session-Id` header forwarded to Hermes gateway for session continuity

### Fixed
- **Skills Discover tab showing "0 discoverable skills"** — hub cache path now uses `getConfiguredHermesHome()` (profile-aware) instead of `getHermesHome()` (root `~/.hermes`), matching where the CLI writes its cache
- **Hub cache reader** expanded to read ALL `.json` index files (repo indexes, browse results), not just `skills_sh_search_*` files, with `Array.isArray()` guard for non-array files
- **Hydration mismatch** — Resume button changed from nested `<button>` to `<span role="button">` with proper keyboard handlers (Enter/Space) to fix HTML validity warning
- Session open handler extracted and streamlined to properly reset all composer state

## [0.2.4] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Daemon mode** — run Pan as a background process with `--daemon` / `-d`
- `npx pan-ui stop` — gracefully stop the daemon
- `npx pan-ui status` — check running state, PID, port, log path
- `npx pan-ui logs` — tail daemon log output
- **Systemd user service** — `npx pan-ui service install` creates a persistent service with auto-start
- `npx pan-ui service remove` — cleanly uninstall the service
- Double-start prevention and stale PID recovery
- Port override via `--port` flag

### Fixed
- Duplicate `PORT` env var when systemd reads `.env.local`

## [0.2.3] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **npm packaging** — `.next/` build artifacts were excluded from the tarball because npm was using `.gitignore` rules. Added `.npmignore` to override.
- Removed hardcoded `outputFileTracingRoot` from `next.config.ts` (was causing path mismatches in standalone builds)
- Added runtime path patching (`patchStandalonePaths()`) in the CLI launcher for belt-and-suspenders reliability

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- CI publish workflow: skip `prepublishOnly` in publish jobs with `--ignore-scripts`
- Dual-publish to npm and GitHub Packages on release

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- Publish workflow and README `npx` command corrections
- Package renamed to `@euraika-labs/pan-ui` (scoped npm org)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Skills Hub** — browse and install 268+ skills from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace
- **Memory overhaul** — global + profile-scoped memory with `§`-separated entry parsing
- **Profile editor** — AI-powered config.yaml + SOUL.md editing
- **Profile creation** — full profile lifecycle management

### Changed
- Rebranded from *Hermes Workspace* to **Pan by Euraika**
- Comprehensive UI token standardization — border radius, font sizes, opacity tiers, shared Button component
- Light mode improvements (muted foreground, border/input colors)
- Sidebar active state redesigned to accent bar

### Fixed
- Cookie `secure: false` for local-first HTTP usage
- Skills always written to global `~/.hermes/skills/` directory
- `jsdom` pinned to `^25` (v29 ESM top-level await breaks Vitest)
- Static chunk 404s resolved via `outputFileTracingRoot`
- CodeQL shell-command-injection-from-environment vulnerability
- Vulnerable dependencies upgraded

### Security
- CodeQL analysis enabled on every push and PR
- Allowlist guard on CLI commands before `execFileSync`

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- Initial release of Hermes Workspace WebUI
- Chat with streaming (SSE-based, OpenAI-compatible)
- Skills browser with installed skills view
- Extensions and MCP server management
- Memory inspector
- Profile-based workspace isolation
- Settings: runtime health, runs, audit, telemetry, approvals
- CI pipeline (lint, test, build)
- Dependabot configuration
- Community standards (CoC, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, issue templates)
