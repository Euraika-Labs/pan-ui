Known alpha constraints
- Core reads/writes are now substantially real-backed, but some UX layers still use fallback/mock behavior when Hermes runtime APIs are unavailable
- Voice input is mock-assisted rather than full speech-to-text
- TTS uses browser speech synthesis when available
- Attachment binary/object storage is local app persistence, not yet integrated into a broader artifact backend
- True live Hermes internal approval resume is still evolving; current server-side gating is strongest on the app-controlled stream path
- Mobile UX is validated but not yet deeply polished
